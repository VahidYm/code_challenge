# Code Challenge
## Requirements
- Node 18.x or higher
- yarn or npm

## Get started
Install packages by running the following:
```bash
$ yarn install 
```

## How it works
To run tests:
```bash
$ yarn test
```

To run the server:
```bash
$ yarn start
```
Now you can access the app in your browser: `localhost:3030`  
Or send requests by postman: `Boo.postman_collection.json` file
